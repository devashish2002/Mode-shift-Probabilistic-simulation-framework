## Probabilistic Simulation Framework Assessing the Impacts of Ridesharing and Manhattan Congestion Surcharge

Code for paper 'Transportation Interventions Reshaping NYC Commute: the Probabilistic Simulation Framework Assessing the Impacts of Ridesharing and Manhattan Congestion Surcharge' (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06588)

The paper presents an individual mode-choice and mode-shift simulation model and the Bayesian inference framework. It accounts for uncertainties in the data as well as the model estimate and translates them into uncertainties of the resulting mode-shift and the impacts. The framework is evaluated on the two intervention cases: introducing ride-sharing for-hire-vehicles in NYC as well the recent introduction of the Manhattan Congestion Surcharge. Being successfully evaluated on the cases above, the framework can be used for assessing mode-shift and resulting economic, social and environmental implications for any future urban transportation solutions and policies being considered by decision-makers or transportation companies.
